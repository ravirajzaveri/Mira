# Vercel Deployment Fix

The deployment failed due to dependency conflicts. Here's what was fixed:

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dependency Conflicts
**Problem**: `databases[postgresql]==0.8.0` requires `sqlalchemy<1.5` but we had `sqlalchemy==2.0.23`

**Solution**: 
- Removed conflicting dependencies (`databases`, `alembic`, `sqlalchemy`)
- Simplified to essential packages for Vercel deployment
- Prisma handles database operations directly

### 2. Next.js Configuration Warning
**Problem**: `Invalid next.config.js options detected: Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'appDir'`

**Solution**: 
- Removed deprecated `experimental.appDir` option
- Next.js 14 uses App Router by default

### 3. Import Issues for Vercel
**Problem**: Relative imports (`from ..module`) don't work well with Vercel Python functions

**Solution**: 
- Created simplified `/api/index.py` for basic Vercel deployment
- Fixed import paths to use absolute imports
- Separated core FastAPI app for Vercel compatibility

## New Structure

```
jewelry-erp-webapp/
├── frontend/          # Next.js app
├── api/              # Simplified Vercel API
│   ├── index.py      # Basic FastAPI app
│   └── requirements.txt
├── backend/          # Full FastAPI app (for local dev)
└── vercel.json       # Updated configuration
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Current State**: Basic API deployment works
2. **Next Phase**: Add database connection after basic deployment succeeds
3. **Final Phase**: Migrate full functionality to Vercel-compatible structure

## Simplified Requirements

```txt
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
pydantic==2.5.0
```

This minimal setup should deploy successfully to Vercel.

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. Add Prisma to the API
2. Configure Neon database connection
3. Add routes incrementally
4. Test each addition before proceeding

This step-by-step approach ensures we can identify and fix issues as they arise.
